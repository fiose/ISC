    "- The essential step concerns lines 8-9 and 14-15, where the update of the current approximation of the solution takes place. <u>Avoid extra loops as much as possible</u>. Use the vectorisations of Numpy: you can compute all row or column sums in one go by the routine sum. A complete column or row i of a matrix f you obtain via *f(:, i)* or *f(i, :)*, respectively. Subtracting the same number β from a complete row or column can be easily done via the function ones(). Use Google.\n",
